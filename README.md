## Setup Secrets

In order to generate game sheets you will need to setup your local secrets to login to yrsl team manager site. Open file `generate_secret.py` and modify the teams dictionary with your login and password information for each team. Run the python script and two files will be created within your local directory. 

```bash
python generate_secret.py
```

You now have the encrypted configuration set.

# Setup your team configuration file
Create a new team config file from a copy of `team-config.sample.json` and fill out the missing pieces of information.

# Creating a Roster File
A roster file is required when running the tool in mode generate-email or generate-gamesheet. Create a new roster file from a copy of the `roster-example.sample.json` file and fill out of the names of the team members. Goal keepers should be denoted by a suffix GK.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The names of the players must match what has been entered within the YRSL website team management page (https://yorkregionsl.com/team-management/?pg=gs).
